## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes Airbnb listings, pricing, bookings, and customer engagement across different neighborhoods and room types.
The goal is to uncover data-driven insights that can help hosts, analysts, and stakeholders understand market trends, optimize pricing strategies, and identify high-demand locations.

The dashboard provides a clear view of host performance, neighborhood-wise pricing, booking trends, and review behavior using intuitive visualizations.

## Problem Statement
Airbnb stakeholders often struggle to answer key business questions such as:
- Which neighborhoods generate the highest bookings and reviews?
- How does pricing vary by neighborhood and room type?
- Which room types are most popular across locations?
- What are the monthly booking and review trends?
- Which hosts receive the highest customer engagement?

This project addresses these challenges by converting raw Airbnb data into actionable insights through Tableau visual analytics.
